Write a Bash script that displays the content of the file /etc/passwd, using the while loop + IFS.



Format: The user USERNAME is part of the GROUP_ID gang, lives in HOME_DIRECTORY and rides COMMAND/SHELL. USER ID's place is protected by the passcode PASSWORD, more info about the user here: USER ID INFO



Requirements:



You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden)
